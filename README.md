3. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit dropdown menu. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface. Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate the validity of the blockchain.

The screenshot below shows verifying block content (Transaction No.3 -  Paul sent Ella $620) and validating the chain.
